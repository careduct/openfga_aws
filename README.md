# OpenFGA HTTP Endpoint Deployment on AWS Lambda and Amazon RDS

Welcome to our repository! Here, you'll find all the necessary code to deploy the HTTP endpoint of OpenFGA on AWS Lambda and Amazon RDS. This guide will walk you through the steps to get everything up and running.

## Overview

OpenFGA is a flexible, open-source authorization service that enables developers to manage access control. Deploying OpenFGA's HTTP endpoint on AWS Lambda allows for scalable, serverless function execution, while Amazon RDS handles the database management, providing a robust and scalable infrastructure for your authorization needs.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:
- An AWS account
- AWS CLI installed and configured
- Basic knowledge of AWS services (Lambda, RDS, IAM)
- Familiarity with OpenFGA

## Deployment Steps

1. **Prepare Your AWS Environment:**
   - Set up an RDS instance for OpenFGA's database needs.
   - Create an IAM role for Lambda with the necessary permissions.

2. **Deploy the Lambda Function:**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine.
   - Use the AWS CLI or AWS Management Console to create a new Lambda function.
   - Upload the code from this repository to your Lambda function.

3. **Configure the Environment Variables:**
   - Set up the necessary environment variables for your Lambda function, including database connection details.

4. **Test Your Deployment:**
   - Invoke your Lambda function to ensure the HTTP endpoint is working correctly.
   - Perform any necessary adjustments based on the test results.
